Arcade game (revisited)
===============================

# Introduction

This is the third project in the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree. It's a javascript game. I'm a designer, so I decided to *change the metaphor game* to suit my users, the Udacity teachers: instead of a player against bugs, I have a code bug against programmes.

## How it works
- run index.html in your browser, the game will start automagically
- how to play the game: keyboard => 'arrows' to move, 'spacebar' to start a new game

- enjoy!
